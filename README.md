<p>Optimizing the Rydberg Hamiltoninan is the curcial process as it helps in reducing the 
<br>Quantum Scarring which is crucial for increasing the probability density of quantum system arounds the path of unstable classical periodic orbits.Phase space distribution or the scarring resembles periodic orbits of the quantum eigen states.
   While phase-space localization is essential for the low degreee of sperading this phenomenon has very iteresting applications on how <br>
